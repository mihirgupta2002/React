# React


My journey of learning React has started from making minor projects in react which i have uploaded in this repository.
I learned these projects from Angela who is an Instructor on a course i purchased on Udemy.
Thanks to her i have been able to complete the basics of react framework. 
I'm uploading all that im learning in this repository to keep track of all the things i have learned when i look 2 years back in past when i graduate.
